# ✨StarBot 2✨
It's StarBot, but better!

*This is a JDA rewrite of PaladinBot, think PaladinBot 2.0*

## Code Policies
All new features or modifications should be made in a separate branch and PR'd (Pull Requested) into development. **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU COMMIT AND PUSH TO MASTER.** It is preferred that you sign your commits with a GPG key if possible.

## Weekly Updates
As of September 26th, 2019, StarBot2's developers will try their best to update StarBot2 every week on Saturday. These updates will either consist of new features, bug fixes, refinements, or general source code refactoring.
