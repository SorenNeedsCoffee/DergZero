# üêâDergZeroüêâ
Official discord bot of the Draconium Server

*This is a JDA rewrite of PaladinBot, think PaladinBot 2.0*

Written by Soren Dangaard (JoeSorensen) with help from ValgoBoi and WardleDeBoss for his own discord server. 

## Code Policies
All new features or modifications should be made in a separate branch and PR'd (Pull Requested) into development. **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU COMMIT AND PUSH TO MASTER.** It is preferred that you sign your commits with a GPG key if possible.

## Weekly Updates
As of September 26th, 2019, DergZero's developers will try their best to update DergZero every week on Saturday. These updates will either consist of new features, bug fixes, refinements, or general source code refactoring.
